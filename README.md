🔍 Key Insights:

- Party Dominance by Region: With the help of Treemap and Pie Chart visualizations, we analyzed how the Republican Party has remained dominant in the South, while the Northeast and West have leaned more Democratic.
- The Midwest, as expected, continues to be a battleground region with a history of swinging between parties in recent elections.
- Close Elections (Narrow Victory Analysis): We calculated the margin of victory between the winner and runner-up to highlight key swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania, where election outcomes are often determined by razor-thin margins. 🗺️

- The Midwest, which has seen shifts in party loyalty, will likely play a critical role.
